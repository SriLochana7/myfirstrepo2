Explanation

1. The Shopping Mall Discount Program is created to calculate the final bill amount after applying a discount based on the customer’s total purchase.
<br>

2. The program first takes the bill amount as input from the user using the input() function and converts it into a floating-point number using float() to handle decimal values.
   <br>

3. It then checks the entered amount and decides which discount to apply using if, elif, and else conditions.

<br>
4. If the bill amount is ₹5000 or more, the program gives a 20% discount on the total amount.
<br>

5. If the bill amount is between ₹2000 and ₹4999, the program provides a 10% discount.
<br>

6. If the bill amount is below ₹2000, no discount is applied, and the total remains the same.
<br>

7. The discount amount is calculated by multiplying the total amount with the respective discount percentage.

<br>
8. The final total is obtained by subtracting the discount from the original bill amount.


9. The program then displays the discount amount and final bill clearly, using two decimal places for neatness and accuracy.


10. Overall, this program helps customers easily find out their savings and total payable amount after the discount.
